I'm interested in math, statistics, programming, biology and their unions, intersections, and applications.

Previously I designed and trained neural networks to learn features of the human genome that control gene expression relevant to Alzheimer's Disease ðŸ§ 

Currently working on showing that seed-chain-extend, a popular alignment method, is accurate under realistic conditions (insertions, deletions, and substitions) and runs in quasilinear time.
