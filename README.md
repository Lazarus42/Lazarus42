I'm currently interested in technical AI development and alignment.

Previously, I designed and trained neural networks in the Pfenning Lab at Carnegie Mellon to learn features of the human genome that control gene expression relevant to Alzheimer's Disease ðŸ§ . I also worked with Yun William Yu to show that seed-chain-extend, a popular alignment heuristic, is accurate under realistic conditions (insertions, deletions, and substitions) and runs in quasilinear time.
